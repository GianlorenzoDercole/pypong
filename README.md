# Pong with pygame
I plan to use pygame to build the classic arcade game pong.  I will use the documentation and some tutorials.  I would like to have a fucntional two player pong.  The user is anyone who likes video games.  Raodbloakcs may include learning pygame fast enough to build the project.

# Description
A clone of the classic game Pong.  I would like to add a bit of extra style, depending on what I can do with pygame.

# User flow
Fork and clone the repo and install pygame.  Bre coffee and enjoy

# Technologies used
This game is built using Python and pygame.

# User Stories
The user for this game is anyone who enjoys playing classic video games, or anyone who just wants to take a quick break.  They can play the game by themselves or they can play with a friend.

# Approach
I began by looking through the pygame docs and watching some tutorials.  I set up some boiler plate code for the screen and the ball, then I began to implement the game logic piece by piece.  I used some tutorials for making the clickable text.

Once the player vs player was working, I began to implement logic for the player vs computer.  I then styled the options menu to look like the game board.

# MVP
+ build a working a two player copy of pong
# Stretch
+ built a player vs computer version of pong
+ add some cool effects and animations
+ build a 3d version

# Hurdles
Overall I did not have too many stumbling blocks while building this project.  Working with pygame was a small hurdle for me because it was my first time using it.  Figuring out the ai for the player vs computer was difficult and took some time.

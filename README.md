# Pong with pygame
I plan to use pygame to build the classic arcade game pong.  I will use the documentation and some tutorials.  I would like to have a functional two player pong.

# Screen Shot

# User Stories
The user for this game is anyone who enjoys playing classic video games, or anyone who just wants to take a quick break.  They can play the game by themselves against the computer or they can play with a friend.

# Approach
I began by looking through the pygame docs and watching some tutorials.  I set up some boiler plate code for the screen and the ball, then I began to implement the game logic piece by piece.  I used some tutorials for making the clickable text.

Once the player vs player was working, I began to implement logic for the player vs computer.  I then styled the options menu to look like the game board.

# MVP
+ build a working a two player copy of pong
# Stretch
+ build a player vs computer version of pong
+ add some cool effects and animations
+ build a 3d version

# Hurdles
Overall I did not have too many stumbling blocks while building this project.  Working with pygame was a small hurdle for me because it was my first time using this technology.  Figuring out the ai for the player vs computer was difficult and took some time.
